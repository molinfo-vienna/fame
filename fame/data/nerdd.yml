  title: Prediction of Phase 1 and Phase 2 Sites of Metabolism (SoMs)
  description: |
    FAME 3 is a collection of machine learning models for prediction of both phase 1 and
    phase 2 sites of metabolism (SoMs). SoMs are atoms where a metabolic reaction gets
    initiated and, thus, are a good starting point for determining the metabolic fate of
    xenobiotic compounds.

    FAME 3 was developed in collaboration with Dr. Angelica Mazzolari, Prof. Alessandro
    Pedretti and Prof. Giulio Vistoli from the Drug Design Laboratory of the University
    of Milan and em. Prof. Bernard Testa from the University of Lausanne.

    FAME 3 is free for non-commercial and academic research. For-profit institutions may
    use FAME 3 for testing purposes and contact us for a commercial licence.

    ## FAME 3: Phase I and Phase II Site of Metabolism Prediction

    Metabolism of xenobiotics plays a crucial role in safety and efficacy of not only
    drugs, but also cosmetics or agrochemicals. However, even despite significant
    advances in analytical methods, experimental determination of metabolites still
    remains a labour-intensive and costly endeavor. Therefore, the prospect of an
    accurate and fast computational method for prediction of human metabolism is very
    attractive. FAME 3 represents a humble step in this direction by providing
    predictions of the so called sites of metabolism (SoMs). SoMs are atoms where a
    reaction catalyzed by a metabolic enzyme is initiated and, thus, their
    identification is useful in determining the metabolic fate of a compound. It can
    also serve as the first step in the direct prediction of formed metabolites (see
    [GLORY](https://nerdd.univie.ac.at/glory/about/)).

    ### About FAME 3

    FAME 3 is the third generation of the [FAst
    MEtabolizer](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci400503s) program developed for the
    prediction of SoMs. [FAME 2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00250)
    featured an improved machine learning methodology, but was only limited to a handful
    of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) isoforms.

    FAME 3 uses the improved methodology of FAME 2 and applies it to a new data set that
    extends not only beyond CYPs in phase I transformations, but also includes data on
    many phase II reactions as well. The FAME 3 program uses a set of extra trees models
    that are trained on the [MetaQSAR
    database](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01473), which is a
    large expert-curated database of metabolic transformations relating to both phase I
    and phase II metabolic enzymes. With data on more than 5,000 phase I SoMs and 1,200
    phase II SoMs, this is a significant enhancement when compared to FAME 2.

    In addition to FAME 2, FAME 3 also features an applicability domain measure (called
    FAMEscore), which evaluates how similar the environment of an atom is to the
    environments in the training set of the model. FAMEscore correlates with model
    performance and, thus, informs the program user about the likely accuracy of each
    prediction.

    ### Using the FAME 3 webserver

    #### Submitting Calculations

    Enter SMILES, draw a molecule, or upload a file (.smi or .sdf) containing up to 1000
    molecules. Click submit to start the calculation. You will then be forwarded to the
    result page.

    #### Collecting results

    The FAME 3 output for each submitted substrate is displayed on the results page
    after the calculation finishes (for about 50 molecules of average size, this should
    be within a few minutes). You can use the accordion buttons to display the
    prediction page for each submitted molecule one by one. The prediction page contains
    the structure of the substrate and a table with the predictions.

    Each atom is assigned a unique ID within the molecule (the "Atom column"), which is
    also displayed at the corresponding atom position in the structure upon hovering
    over it with a mouse. The table is sorted according to the SoM probability assigned
    by the model (the "Probability" column) and the SoMs past the decision threshold of
    the model are also highlighted with yellow color. The FAMEscore value is shown in
    the last column of the table. Usually, FAMEscore values higher than 0.6 indicate
    that the prediction should be well supported by the model, but in some cases the
    model was found to perform well even if FAMEscore was lower (see the FAME 3 paper
    for further discussion).
